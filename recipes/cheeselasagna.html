          <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <p>In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat and saute garlic for 2 minutes; stir in spaghetti sauce and Italian seasoning. Heat sauce until warmed through, stirring occasionally, 2 to 5 minutes.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> <p>Spread 1/2 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spread half the ricotta mixture over noodles; top with another noodle layer. Pour 1 1/2 cups of sauce over noodles, and spread the remaining ricotta over the sauce. Top with remaining noodles and sauce and sprinkle mozzarella over all. Cover with greased foil.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> <p>Bake 45 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and top is golden.</p></li>
